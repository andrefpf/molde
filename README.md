# MOLDE
MOPT Lightweight Design Environment (MOLDE) is a library created to standardize and make easier the creation and maintainance of internal products of the Multidisciplinary Optimization Group (MOPT).

Here are the colors, icons, fonts and common interface components, that may be usefull for multiple MOPT projects.

This is heavily inspired by [Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) and [Bold Design System](https://bold.bridge.ufsc.br/pt/).
